My personal answers to a few chosen exercises in the book Monte Carlo Statistical Methods by Robert and Casella. 
It contains examples of random variable generation, Monte Carlo implementations, and Markov Chains. 


Special note for other students in courses based on this book: feel free to read my code and reuse its "spirit" but please, no copy paste :)
